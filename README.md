# Noodl - A Discord.JS Funbot
*Noodl is 100% open source now!*

## What is Noodl?
Noodl is a Discord Fun bot, origianally created for a Discord community, then never used again. Now I have taken the old source and recoded it with the new Discord.JS version.

The bot features around loads of fun commands, as well as some basic moderation commands like **prune**, **kick** and **ban**.
Of course I'm not packing the bot with other stuff like music, etc, as this is a fun bot ;)
